## Installation

Check that Python3 is installed using `source check.sh`. Then, run the installation using `source install.sh`.

In case the installation script fails, you may execute the contents of the bash script line by line:

1. Setup a new virtual environment: `python3 -m virtualenv env`.
1. Start the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`.
1. Install all requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

> To activate the virtual environment for the future, use `source activate.sh`.
